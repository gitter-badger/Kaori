## What is this?
This is a Game Framework I wrote with Go. I created to fill my time and probably for my games in the future.

I love Go. Go is the best programming language I've ever learned. If you want to know more, [Read my blog post](https://yukiisbored.tumblr.com/post/144328019233/why-the-go-programming-language-is-the-best-modern)

## Disclaimer
English is **not** my native language and I'm sorry If there's a grammar error. I **don't** consider this as a "high-priority" project and because I'm a Senior High Student, I can **only** code on my free time. I **dont** consider myself as a "professional" and neither should you. I made this project just because I can and for the sake of anti-boredom.

Thanks,
